  <h2>Overview of ABNF Strategic Plan</h2>
  <p>ABNF being a Faith Based Organization, will create programs that are committed to discipleship and evangelism in obedience to the Lord’s biblical command on loving the neighbour. ABNF’s board, secretariat, and staff, in their work with targeted communities, will therefore seek to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Walk in obedience to God in all areas of life.</li>
    <li>Love through their service to the communities and other stakeholders.</li>
    <li>Emphasize true transformation to the community based on the Word of God.</li>
    <li>Be creative and discover unique ways to serve others.</li>
    <li>Create hope based on God’s truth that we are made in the likeness of God and loved by Him.</li>
    <li>Encourage the discovery and identification of God’s gift and resources, and their wise utilization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By focusing first on the community and using locally accessible resources to transform individuals, families, and communities, ABNF will aim to guide the community in practicing the act of love as it was practiced by the first Church. Then, it will look outward to reinforce the transformation that has already been established.</p>
  <p>ABNF also seeks to support communities to discover the resources within their reach and unlocking their potential. Our aim is to begin small and simple by starting with what they know, believe and value in accordance with Mathew 13:32 ‘… though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.</p>
  <p>This Strategic Plan, 2024–2028 has been prepared by ABNF in response to the dynamic context for which the foundation seeks to implement interventions. This plan is derived from consultations with communities both directly and indirectly, consultations with opinion leaders and professionals from across sectoral divides and from documentation review of respective county integrated development plans (CIDPs), which are developed based on extensive consultations with communities.</p>
  <p>This Strategic Plan serves as a commitment to which ABNF will abide to, bearing in mind the realities within which it operates, and ensure that it facilitates the growth of individuals, families, communities, and other stakeholders reached out to through the foundation.</p>
  <p>This plan defines the sectors that ABNF will provide interventions for and the role of the foundation and other stakeholders towards achieving the vision, mission, core values and sectoral objectives of the foundation.</p>
