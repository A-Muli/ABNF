  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>The story of the Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi Foundation (ABNF) began with the deep love and compassion...</p>
  <p>Over the years, they started many small but powerful projects. They gave sewing machines to women and helped them learn tailoring, so they could support their families. They bought bicycles for evangelists to help them reach far-away places and share the Gospel. They also provided water tanks for families who didn’t have access to clean water, and they offered food to those suffering from hunger and drought.</p>

  <p>In addition, they helped people in need by providing goats, chickens, and even cows, so families could earn a living. They also started a center called <strong>St. Thomas of the Open Door</strong>, where people struggling with mental health or addiction could find hope, care, and healing through the love of Christ.</p>

  <p>Because of their dedication, the ABN Foundation was created to continue their mission. Today, the foundation focuses on three main areas: supporting the Church, helping children and young people grow in faith and character, and serving the community through practical programs like feeding the elderly and providing clothing to those in need.</p>

  <p>The journey of ABNF is one of love, leadership, and faith in action. It is a story about changing lives, one step at a time, and building a stronger, kinder, and more hopeful future for everyone.</p>

  <h2>Overview of ABNF Strategic Plan</h2>
  <p>ABNF being a Faith Based Organization, aims to create programs that are committed to discipleship and evangelism in obedience to the Lord’s biblical command on loving the neighbour. ABNF’s board, secretariat, and staff, in their work with targeted communities, will therefore seek to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Walk in obedience to God in all areas of life.</li>
    <li>Love through their service to the communities and other stakeholders.</li>
    <li>Emphasize true transformation to the community based on the Word of God.</li>
    <li>Be creative and discover unique ways to serve others.</li>
    <li>Create hope based on God’s truth that we are made in the likeness of God and loved by Him.</li>
    <li>Encourage the discovery and identification of God’s gift and resources, and their wise utilization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By focusing first on the community and using locally accessible resources to transform individuals, families, and communities, ABNF will aim to guide the community in practicing the act of love as it was practiced by the first Church. Then, it will look outward to reinforce the transformation that has already been established.</p>
  <p>ABNF also seeks to support communities to discover the resources within their reach and unlocking their potential. Our aim is to begin small and simple by starting with what they know, believe and value in accordance with Mathew 13:32 ‘… though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.</p>
  <p>This Strategic Plan, 2024–2028 has been prepared by ABNF in response to the dynamic context for which the foundation seeks to implement interventions. This plan is derived from consultations with communities both directly and indirectly, consultations with opinion leaders and professionals from across sectoral divides and from documentation review of respective county integrated development plans (CIDPs), which are developed based on extensive consultations with communities.</p>
  <p>This Strategic Plan serves as a commitment to which ABNF will abide to, bearing in mind the realities within which it operates, and ensure that it facilitates the growth of individuals, families, communities, and other stakeholders reached out to through the foundation.</p>
  <p>This plan defines the sectors that ABNF will provide interventions for and the role of the foundation and other stakeholders towards achieving the vision, mission, core values and sectoral objectives of the foundation.</p>
