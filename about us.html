  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi Foundation (ABNF)</strong> is a faith-based organization dedicated to holistic community transformation through discipleship, capacity building, and sustainable development. Rooted in Christian values, ABNF believes in empowering individuals, families, and institutions to grow spiritually, socially, and economically.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our approach is informed by biblical principles such as Luke 14:28–30 and Matthew 13:32, encouraging communities to start small, use local resources, and grow into fully empowered and self-sustaining entities.
